Quizzify is a full-stack web application designed to support structured digital study and review workflows. The platform combines modern web technologies with adaptive learning logic to help users create, organize, and review study materials more effectively.

This project was developed as both a technical exploration of full-stack software engineering and an experiment in applying AI-assisted development and adaptive review techniques in a real-world application.

## 🧠 Adaptive Learning Logic

Quizzify integrates adaptive review techniques inspired by Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and spaced repetition principles. The system models learner progress using mastery thresholds and review scheduling logic to personalize study sessions based on user performance.

This component was implemented to explore how adaptive algorithms can improve learning efficiency in digital study tools.
